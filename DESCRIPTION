Description: Provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
    Warping (TWDTW) method for land use and land cover mapping using satellite
    image time series. TWDTW is based on the Dynamic Time Warping technique and
    has achieved high accuracy for land use and land cover classification using
    satellite data. The method is based on comparing unclassified satellite image
    time series with a set of known temporal patterns (e.g. phenological cycles
    associated with the vegetation). Using 'dtwSat' the user can build temporal
    patterns for land cover types, apply the TWDTW analysis for satellite datasets,
    visualize the results of the time series analysis, produce land cover maps, and
    create temporal plots for land cover change analysis.
