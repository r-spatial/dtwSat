#' Shift Dates to Start on a Specified Origin Year
#'
#' Shifts a vector of dates to start on the same day-of-year in a specified origin year
#' while preserving the relative difference in days among the observations. 
#' This way the temporal pattern (e.g., seasonality) inherent to the original dates 
#' will also be preserved in the shifted dates.
#'
#' The primary goal of this function is to align a sequence of dates based on the day-of-year
#' in a desired origin year. This can be particularly useful for comparing or visualizing
#' two or more time series with different absolute dates but aiming to align them based on
#' the day-of-year or another relative metric.
#'
#' @param x A vector of date strings or Date objects representing the sequence to shift.
#' @param origin A date string or Date object specifying the desired origin year for the shifted dates.
#' Default is "1970-01-01".
#'
#' @return A vector of Date objects with the shifted dates starting on the same day-of-year in the specified origin year.
