\title{Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Satellite Image Time Series}
\description{
Provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping 
(TWDTW) method for land use and land cover mapping using satellite image time series [1]. 
TWDTW is based on the Dynamic Time Warping technique and has achieved high accuracy 
for land use and land cover classification using satellite data. The method is based 
on comparing unclassified satellite image time series with a set of known temporal 
patterns (e.g. phenological cycles associated with the vegetation). Using 'dtwSat' 
the user can build temporal patterns for land cover types, apply the TWDTW analysis 
for satellite datasets, visualize the results of the time series analysis, produce 
land cover maps, and create temporal plots for land cover change analysis.
